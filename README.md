# WOZLLA.js

**WOZLLA.js** is a JavaScript/TypeScript 2D Game Engine, it aims to provide a complete solution for HTML5
games creation. It uses WebGL for 2D rendering and is NOT compatible with Canvas2D.

## Getting Started

```javascript
// create director and start main loop
var director = new WOZLLA.Director(document.getElementById('canvas'));
director.start();

// new a GameObject
var gameObj = new WOZLLA.GameObject();
// create a sprite renderer
var spriteRenderer = new WOZLLA.component.SpriteRenderer();
// set image src
spriteRenderer.imageSrc = 'images/panda.png';
// add to gameObj
gameObj.addComponent(spriteRenderer);

// this would automatically load all assets of gameObj, children and children's children.
gameObj.loadAssets(function() {
    // init gameObj
    gameObj.init();
    // add to stage
    director.stage.addChild(gameObj);
});
```
